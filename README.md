# notes.linderttobias.com

Welcome to the repository for [notes.linderttobias.com](https://notes.linderttobias.com), a personal blog powered by Hugo and GitHub Pages. This blog serves as a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and notes on various topics.

## Features

- **Hugo-powered**: This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy deployment and version control.
- **Theme**: Uses the [Hugo Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme.

## Usage

### Write new blog posts

Adding new blog posts is simple:

1.  Create a new post using the Hugo CLI:
    ```bash
    hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
    ```
    Alternatively, create a file manually in `content/posts/`.

2.  Update the frontmatter in the created file (e.g., `content/posts/my-new-post.md`). Ensure `draft` is set to `false` when ready to publish.
    ```toml
    +++
    title = 'My New Post'
    date = 2025-12-29T12:00:00+01:00
    draft = false
    +++
    ```

3.  Add your content below the frontmatter using Markdown.

### Run locally

1.  Ensure you have [Hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/installation/).
2.  Run the server:
    ```bash
    hugo server -D
    ```
    The `-D` flag includes draft content.
3.  Visit `http://localhost:1313`.

### Repository Structure & Git

When contributing to this repository, it is important to know what files to track.

**Files to Commit:**
*   `content/`: All your markdown content (posts, pages).
*   `hugo.toml`: The main configuration file.
*   `layouts/`, `static/`, `assets/`: Any custom overrides or assets you create.
*   `.github/`: Workflow configurations for GitHub Actions.
*   `.gitignore`: Defines what Git should ignore.
*   `README.md`: Project documentation.

**Files NOT to Commit:**
*   `public/`: This directory is generated by Hugo. The GitHub Actions workflow handles the build and deployment, so this folder should not be pushed to the `main` branch.
*   `resources/_gen/`: Generated assets (like processed SCSS).

### Publish

1.  Stage your content and configuration changes:
    ```bash
    git add content/ layouts/ hugo.toml
    ```
    *(Avoid `git add .` if you have generated files in your workspace)*

2.  Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add new post"
    ```

3.  Push to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
    The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy the site.
